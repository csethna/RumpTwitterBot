About this repo: Twitter has become an integral part of the public discourse. The @realtrumpybot project serves to preserve the public record by creating a real-time mirror of the President's personal twitter handle. The @realtrumpybot reminds its audience of the gravitas of these special tweets by generating Executive Order memes fit for display in the future DJT presidential library.
